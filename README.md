# project Bits

The goal with project Bits is to change the consumer electronics market to create products which are better to repair for the end user and help designers create these products. This Github page will therefore mainly not be used to upload Code, even though this is a possibility. But mainly for CAD drawings, templates and documentation. 

## licensing
Anything on this Github page is open to adjust and use for personal purposes for now. If it's going to be adopted into a production line product please contact me first.
